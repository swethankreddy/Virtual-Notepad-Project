Gesture-Based Text Creation - Virtual Notepad

Overview

This project, "Gesture-Based Text Creation aka Virtual Notepad and Recognition," aims to create a digital canvas where users can write and draw in the air using their fingers. The gestures are captured and displayed on a computer screen, leveraging Machine Learning (ML), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and OpenCV to recognize and classify hand-drawn inputs, such as digits.

Features

Hand Tracking: Real-time detection and tracking of hand positions using OpenCV and mediapipe.

Digit Recognition: Classification of hand-drawn digits using a CNN trained on the mnist dataset.

Drawing Mode: Allows users to draw in the air with color selection options.

Volume Control: Adjust device volume using finger gestures.

Image Saving: Save drawn images for later use.
